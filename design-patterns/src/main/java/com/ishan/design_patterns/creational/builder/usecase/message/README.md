# Builder Pattern Implementation for a messaging service

## Problem Statement

You are developing a messaging application with support for various message types, including text, images, audio, and
video. Each message type can have additional attributes and settings, such as delivery status and timestamps. The
current approach of creating message objects using multiple overloaded constructors has become error-prone and
challenging to maintain. You should streamline the creation of message objects with different configurations and
immutable objects.

## Assignment

Your task is to implement the Builder pattern to create instances of message objects with different configurations. The
Builder pattern allows for step-by-step construction of complex objects while keeping the creation process separate from
the main object.

## Implementing the Builder Pattern

1. **Review the original class**: You have been provided with a class named `Message`. This class represents different
   message types and their attributes. Your task is to implement the Builder pattern to create instances of a class with
   the same properties.

## Instructions

1. Implement the builder pattern within your `MessageBuilder` class.

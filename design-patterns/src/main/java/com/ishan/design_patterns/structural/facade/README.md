# Facade pattern for a travel booking platform

## Problem Statement

You are working on an online booking platform for travel accommodations. The platform needs to handle bookings,
payments, and notifications through different external services. The goal is to provide a simplified interface for
customers and internal modules to perform booking-related tasks without directly dealing with the intricacies of each
external service.
